# hadoop-fileformat-benchmark-kit
---------------------------------
Aims to be a set of utilities to assist benchmarking performance for different fileformats for a given workload (Hive/Impala). Attributes it cares about -

1. Size of file
2. Compression Ratio
3. Query Performance

**Warning** this is a work in progress. At the moment, it does conversions for single tables using scripts
